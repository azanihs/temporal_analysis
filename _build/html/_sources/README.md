# Workshop 5: Temporal and sequential analysis  

**Instructor**: Quan Nguyen, Ph.D., Teaching Fellow, Master of Data Science
Department of Statistics, University of British Columbia

Data in learning analytics research (e.g. SIS, clickstream, log-files) are often rich in temporal features that could allow us to explore the dynamic changes in learning behavior at different time granularities (e.g. seconds, days, weeks, semesters). This workshop will introduce participants to several common temporal/sequential analysis methods and techniques using R. During the workshop, we will discuss how temporal analysis can be applied to answer RQs in learning analytics and which learning constructs are relevant to temporal analysis. Next, we will go through techniques to explore and visualize temporal/sequential data. Participants will learn and apply two types of temporal models: a) explanatory models using statistical techniques, such as Sequence Analysis with application to identify common patterns of learning activities from log data and b) association rule mining (apriori) with application to detect courses that are frequently taken together and create association rules for course recommendations.   

**Target Audience**:

This workshop is designed for anyone interested in temporal/sequential analysis. No experience in temporal and sequential analysis is required. To get the best learning experience, participants should familiarize themselves with basic statistics and machine learning concepts (e.g. regression, variance, autocorrelation, classification, cross-validation, overfitting).  

Bring a laptop with RStudio installed. More information on the packages will be provided before the workshop

# DSCI 574: Spatial and Temporal Models

An introduction to modelling temporal and spatial data in Python. For time series data, covers decomposition, classical models like exponential smoothing and ARIMA, machine learning, anomaly detection, and more. For spatial data, covers geospatial basics, visualization tools, spatial models such as kriging, and more.
